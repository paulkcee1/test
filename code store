# Note: These are the basic steps to upload code to a new GitHub repository. If you make further changes to your code and wish to update the repository, you'll repeat the add, commit, and push steps. 

# Every time you make changes in your local code that you want to be updated into Github, run these lines (I recommend saving these in your notes somewhere as you will be running these lines a lot):

#----------------------------------------
git add . 
#------------------------------------------
# this line selects all files (. = all) 

#--------------------------------------------------------------
git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE" 

git commit -m "Initial commit"
# this line commits all files selected above and makes them ready to be pushed

# (replace YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE with any message that you want. This will show up in Github so you can differentiate between different commits.)

git push 
# This line pushes your code to Github



# 4. Upload Your Code:

# Navigate to your project's directory using the terminal or command prompt:
# cd path/to/your/project
# (replace path/to/your/project with the actual file path to your project)
# Initialize a new Git repository:
# git init
# Add all your project's files to the staging area:
# git add .
# Commit your changes:
# git commit -m "Initial commit"
# Link your local repository to the one on GitHub:
# git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
# (replace YourUsername and YourRepositoryName with your actual usernam and repositoryname. You can also copy this directly from Github by pressing code -> HTTPS)
# Push (or upload) your code to GitHub:
# git push -u origin master

'''5. Verify:

    Refresh your GitHub repository page in your web browser. You should now see your files listed.

'''Practice:

Now it's time for you to practice: Create a file called hello.py and in it, complete the following tasks.

After that, make sure that you are able to get the code pushed into Github, then do the same every time you complete an assignment.

    Task 1: Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
    Task 2: Ask the user for their name using an input prompt. Then, print a personalized greeting using their name.
    Task 3: Ask the user for two numbers. Print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those two numbers.
        Example output with sample input numbers 5 and 10:
            Sum: 15 Difference: -5 Product: 50 Quotient: 0.5
    Task 4: Ask the user for their age. Print out how old they will be next year.
        Example output with sample input 25:
            Next year, you will be 26 years old.
